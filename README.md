# second exercise in NODE, (EXPRESS)


## things covered today;
* using methods in the server.get() to act as routes, when this path is hit, run this function, instead of having a single large block of code with if else else else etc.
* request and response are shortened to req and res as per express conventions.
* moved our routes out to their own dedicated file /src/routes/tickets.js (look up docs for express router object (middleware))
*
